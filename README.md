I am not the developer of any of the Docker Containers I release!
I am only dockerizing the containers in a Unraid Comunity Applications compatible format.

If you like the work I do, consider donating through my paypal link or my ko-fi link, but also always consider donating to the people who created the software and did the actual hard work! :)
